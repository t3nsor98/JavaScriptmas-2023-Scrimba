# Jolly JavaScriptmas Challenge 🎄

Ho-Ho-Ho! Welcome to the Jolly JavaScriptmas Challenge! 🎅

## What's Decking the Halls?

From December 1st to December 24th, get ready to unwrap a new coding challenge each day. Like an advent calendar, each folder reveals a surprise that'll jingle your coding bells!

## Join the Coding Sleigh Ride:

Tackle the daily challenge and share your solution on Twitter with the hashtag #javascriptmas. It's your ticket to the merry land of potential prizes!

## Gifts Galore:

Every day, you could sleigh your way to an annual Scrimba Pro subscription. But wait, there are even more gifts under the tree! By participating, you're also dashing through the snow towards the Grand Prize Draw on Christmas Eve.

## What's in Santa's Sack?

A shiny 13” MacBook Air M2! The more challenges you complete, the higher the chances of Santa's elves noticing and sending a prize your way, so keep those coding bells jingling and enter as often as you can!

## Santa's Code Review Workshop:

Spread the holiday cheer! Pick a fellow elf’s #javascriptmas entry, record some insightful feedback in a quick scrim, and share it as a reply to their post. On December 24th, five lucky elves will find $100 in their stockings.
